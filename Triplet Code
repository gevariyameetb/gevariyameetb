"""Three numbers, a, b and c, are called a Pythagorean triple if a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . An example
is the triple 3, 4 and 5, since 9 + 16 = 25. Pythagorean triples can represent, for
example, the length of sides in a right triangle. Write a series of Python statements
that will read three numbers into variables named a, b and c and then print a message
saying whether or not they are a Pythagorean triple."""
